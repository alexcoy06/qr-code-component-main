### What I learned,
### Continued development

I need to get more familiar with the basic functions of figma
I need to use CSS resets more often, to learn to use them right.
Normally I download fonts, but I need to practice using them through links as well.
I Need to also use SCSS more, this was my first time using it outside of React, didn're realise how differently it works


### Useful resources

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML - helped me user better markup so I wouldn't use div over and over again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc2olxLgKLk&t=145s - helped me figure out how to move the footer to the bottom, didnt want to use absolute.

## Acknowledgments

I used figma and added the guides to the top and side. Then I clicked and drag on the edges of the guides to do math and figure out the dimensions. If you have experince with drafting or any Auto CAD system, you might understand what im trying to say.
